Meddler - Software to manipulate, disrupt, or cause issues with mass surveillance platforms

This is being developed with two major examples.  It'll be for manipulating the NSA, or GCHQ taps.  I will focus on resources, and examples of both.



Overview:

The point is to replay specific sessions which are intended on manipulating these surveillance programs.

They monitor TCP/IP connections over taps, so if we spoof both sides then we are fine.
If we wish to notice when the NSA injects (Fox Acid) web hacks into our connections, then we need to have control of at least the client side.
If we are just wanting to inject sessions for exhausting government resources, then we can spoof any sites all day long.

1) Monitor our connections to some websites
2) Use tcpreplay to split up the pcaps to client, and server
3) edit the pcaps (maybe dump each packet separately for editing)
4) fix checksums
5) transfer the packets to servers on both sides of the tap
6) replay the sessions (requires root since we are spoofing)
