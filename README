Meddler - Software to manipulate, disrupt, or cause issues with mass surveillance platforms

This is being developed with two major examples.  It'll be for manipulating the NSA, or GCHQ taps.  I will focus on resources, and examples of both.



Overview:

The point is to replay specific sessions which are intended on manipulating these surveillance programs.

They monitor TCP/IP connections over taps, so if we spoof both sides then we are fine.
If we wish to notice when the NSA injects (Fox Acid) web hacks into our connections, then we need to have control of at least the client side.
If we are just wanting to inject sessions for exhausting government resources, then we can spoof any sites all day long.

1) Monitor our connections to some websites
2) Use tcpreplay to split up the pcaps to client, and server
3) edit the pcaps (maybe dump each packet separately for editing)
4) fix checksums
5) transfer the packets to servers on both sides of the tap
6) replay the sessions (requires root since we are spoofing)


I'll start with the capturing, and separation of packets.  I'll look for software to split apart the packets afterwards so that they can be easily modified for changing names, e-mails, etc.

The way to load, and insert profiles should come next.  Once some major sites are captured then macros can be created for each site for automatically injecting certain profiles spoofing possibly wanted people, or targets.

Various messages which can be automatically generated, or wrote my people which will contain things that should set off alarms on these surveillance programs will be required next to replace the macros very quickly.. this will allow inserting millions of false sessions very quickly...

The overall goal is to have a network of a few hundred machines, and it can automaticaly pick and choose IP addresses, and sites and replay on both sides of the tap so that they all appear to be real..
